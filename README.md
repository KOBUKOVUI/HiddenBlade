# Password Strength Estimation Using Machine Learning 🔐

This project leverages **Machine Learning** to estimate the strength of Vietnamese and **English** passwords, helping enhance security by predicting password strength with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features:

- **Multi-language Support** (English & Vietnamese -in future-)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc)
- **Password Strength Estimation** based on features like length, complexity, and dictionary similarity.

## 🛠️ Technologies:

- **Python** & **Scikit-learn** for ML
- **zxcvbn** for password strength labeling
